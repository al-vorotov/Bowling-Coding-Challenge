# Bowling Coding Challenge
- A way to start a new bowling game;
- A way to input the number of pins knocked down by each ball;
- A way to output the current game score (score for each frame and total score).
## Logic details

- Bowling is played by throwing a ball down a narrow alley toward ten wooden pins. The objective is to knock down as many pins as possible per throw.
- The game is played in ten frames. At the beginning of each frame, all ten pins are set up. The player then gets two tries to knock them all down.
- If the player knocks all the pins down on the first try, it is called a "strike,â€œ and the frame ends.
- If the player fails to knock down all the pins with his first ball, but succeeds with the second ball, it is called a "spareâ€œ.
- After the second ball of the frame, the frame ends even if there are still pins standing.
- A strike frame is scored by adding ten, plus the number of pins knocked down by the next two balls, to the score of the previous frame.
- A spare frame is scored by adding ten, plus the number of pins knocked down by the next ball, to the score of the previous frame.
- Otherwise, a frame is scored by adding the number of pins knocked down by the two balls in the frame to the score of the previous frame.
- If a strike is thrown in the tenth frame, then the player may throw two more balls to complete the score of the strike.
- Likewise, if a spare is thrown in the tenth frame, the player may throw one more ball to complete the score of the spare.
- Thus the tenth frame may have three balls instead of two.
